# openrouter-go

A zero-dependency Go package providing complete bindings for the OpenRouter API, supporting all available endpoints with full streaming capabilities.

## Features

- âœ… Complete API coverage (chat completions and legacy completions)
- âœ… Full streaming support with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- âœ… Zero external dependencies
- âœ… Go 1.25.1 support
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- âœ… Context-aware cancellation
- âœ… Thread-safe client operations
- âœ… Extensive configuration options via functional options pattern

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/hra42/openrouter-go
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/hra42/openrouter-go"
)

func main() {
    client := openrouter.NewClient("your-api-key")

    response, err := client.ChatComplete(context.Background(), []openrouter.Message{
        {Role: "user", Content: "Hello, how are you?"},
    }, openrouter.WithModel("openai/gpt-4"))

    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(response.Choices[0].Message.Content)
}
```

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Scope:** Establish project structure and core types
- Set up Go module with appropriate package structure
- Define all request/response structs based on API documentation
- Create base client struct with configuration options
- Implement error types and custom error handling
- Design functional options pattern for optional parameters

### Phase 2: HTTP Communication Layer
**Scope:** Build robust HTTP client functionality
- Implement HTTP request construction and execution
- Add authentication header management
- Create retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully
- Support custom HTTP client injection for testing

### Phase 3: Core API Implementation
**Scope:** Implement both API endpoints
- Implement ChatComplete method for chat completions endpoint
- Implement Complete method for legacy completions endpoint
- Add all optional parameters support (temperature, top_p, etc.)
- Ensure proper request validation
- Handle both streaming and non-streaming responses

### Phase 4: Streaming Support
**Scope:** Full SSE streaming implementation
- Build SSE parser from scratch (no external dependencies)
- Create streaming response types with channel-based API
- Implement proper connection management and cleanup
- Add context cancellation support for streams
- Handle streaming errors and reconnection logic

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
**Scope:** Testing, documentation, and polish
- Write comprehensive unit tests with mocked responses
- Add integration tests (with build tags)
- Create detailed usage examples for common scenarios
- Benchmark performance-critical paths
- Complete API documentation with godoc comments

## API Design

### Client Initialization

```go
// Basic initialization
client := openrouter.NewClient("api-key")

// With options
client := openrouter.NewClient("api-key",
    openrouter.WithBaseURL("https://custom.openrouter.ai"),
    openrouter.WithHTTPClient(customHTTPClient),
    openrouter.WithRetryCount(3),
)
```

### Chat Completions

```go
// Non-streaming
response, err := client.ChatComplete(ctx, messages,
    openrouter.WithModel("anthropic/claude-3-opus"),
    openrouter.WithTemperature(0.7),
    openrouter.WithMaxTokens(1000),
)

// Streaming
stream, err := client.ChatCompleteStream(ctx, messages,
    openrouter.WithModel("anthropic/claude-3-opus"),
)

for event := range stream.Events() {
    fmt.Print(event.Choices[0].Delta.Content)
}

if err := stream.Err(); err != nil {
    // Handle streaming error
}
```

### Legacy Completions

```go
// Non-streaming
response, err := client.Complete(ctx, "Once upon a time",
    openrouter.WithModel("openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"),
    openrouter.WithMaxTokens(100),
)

// Streaming
stream, err := client.CompleteStream(ctx, "Once upon a time",
    openrouter.WithModel("openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"),
)
```
